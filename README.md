# Dev Blogs - Front End

## Project Description

This project is a blog site web application that focuses on providing visitors with simple yet informative blog posts. The front-end design is minimalist and prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to access and read blogs quickly and efficiently. The application was built using Vite, a fast and efficient build tool for modern web development, along with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The Tailwind CSS framework was also used to ensure a streamlined development process.

## What I've Learned

- Proficient use of React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext to manage state and handle side effects in React applications.
- Advanced knowledge of higher-order functions such as .map() and .filter() to dynamically generate components, improving code reusability and modularity.
- Expertise in using the React Router Dom library to enable client-side routing and create a seamless user experience.
- Experienced in storing and authenticating cookies for user authentication and security in web development.
- Ability to implement pagination for faster page load times, leading to an improved user experience.
- Proficient use of Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and consistent code conventions in projects.
- Familiarity with React Quill, a powerful text editor that can be integrated into React applications for creating and editing rich text content.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development using React and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
