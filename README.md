# Dev Blogs - Front End

This project is a blog site web application that focuses on providing visitors with simple yet informative blog posts. The front-end design is minimalist and prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to access and read blogs quickly and efficiently. The application was built using Vite, a fast and efficient build tool for modern web development, along with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The Tailwind CSS framework was also used to ensure a streamlined development process.

## Main Objective

The motivation behind this project is to document my learning journey and share knowledge with readers by providing informative and direct-to-the-point information. Through this blog site web application, I aim to help others learn new concepts and stay updated on relevant topics in a simple and efficient manner. Additionally, this project allows me to practice my development skills and expand my knowledge in web development.

## Key Features

The Dev  Blogs  - Front End offers the following key features:

- *Add new blog posts:* Users can create and publish new blog posts through a simple and intuitive interface.
- *Edit added blog posts:* Users can make changes to existing blog posts, including updating the content, adding images, or modifying the formatting.

## What I've Learned

- Proficient use of React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext to manage state and handle side effects in React applications.
- Advanced knowledge of higher-order functions such as .map() and .filter() to dynamically generate components, improving code reusability and modularity.
- Expertise in using the React Router Dom library to enable client-side routing and create a seamless user experience.
- Experienced in storing and authenticating cookies for user authentication and security in web development.
- Ability to implement pagination for faster page load times, leading to an improved user experience.
- Proficient use of Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and consistent code conventions in projects.
- Familiarity with React Quill, a powerful text editor that can be integrated into React applications for creating and editing rich text content.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development using React and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
